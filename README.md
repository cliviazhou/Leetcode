##LeetCode Algorithms solution

This project maybe(or not) include all solutions of the Leetcode's algoritms exercise. For practicing code skills, I start solve these problems.For each problem i would like to give the C++ code and Python code as well as i can.

It is not easy to finish all of problems, so it will take a period of time to complete. My plan is 2 month. For some diffcult problems, I will record the algorithms and make a explaination.

All code are available and can be accepted, You can clone them and submit to the OJ, but my recommendation is that you should try you best to solve them firstly.

If you have some more genious solution, please tell me.
